I used axios for getting data from The Movie Database API. On the home page you can see Top rated tv show/Popular tv show.
Once you search for any tv show by typing any word. For example 'GAME' it will display all the shows with that name:

You can see the year it was released, the rating, the genre, overview...etc
You can also watch TV Trailer if you want!
